         <h2> Education </h2>
         <p> Hi, my name is Emily Buettner! I am 20 years old. My story is an interesting story full of really funny experiences. I am passionate about many things, one being my education. I am currently a Sophmore majoring in Computer Science at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.</p>
         <p> So far in my educational career I have enjoyed what I do. Although, I'm not exactly sure what I want to do in the technology realm, I can confidently say that I am exicted to be apart of such an innovative career. As for my long term educational goals, I want to finish my bachelors degree at UNO and then get move to a larger city with a warmer climate!

    <h2> Recreation</h2>

    <p> I pride myself with being very outgoing. I spend the majority of my recreational time playing soccer. I have been playing soccer competitvely since I could walk. I played on one of the top teams in Nebraska and got offers to play in college. My senior year of highschool, I got injured playing soccer and had to have surgery on my knee. This injury cost me my collegiate carreer.
    </p>
    <p>Today, I am all healed and still playing soccer at a lesser level. I still have aspirations to be the best player I can be. These goals keep me in shape and help me become a stronger and more focused player and person. With my other recreational time, you can find me hanging out with my friends.
